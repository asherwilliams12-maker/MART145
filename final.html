    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    <h1>Final Portfolio Home Page</h1>

    <h2 id="school"><a href="index.html">5 Page Website</a></h2>
    <p>
        This is my 5 page website project. It includes pages about my school, sports, hobbies, and images. 
        I learned how to create a multi-page website using HTML and CSS. Each page has its own unique content and style.
        I had a blast creating this project and being unique with my selection of images and content I shared.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="bootstrap.html">Bootstrap</a></h2>
    <p>
        This is my Bootstrap project. I decided to make mine about what I see myself doing in the future which is real estate. I used Bootstrap and www.w3schools.com to create a responsive and visually appealing fake Real Estate company. I called it Big Sky Real Estate Group. I was very happy with how it turned out and I learned a lot about using Bootstrap components. This project in my opion was the one I had the most fun doing and I think turned out awesome.


         <h2><a href="images.html">Imagery Examples</a></h2>
         <p> This is my imagery examples project. I used a CSS stylesheet to style the images I edited using Pixlr. I added borders and adjusted the size of the images to make them look better on the webpage. I learned how to use CSS to enhance the visual appeal of images on a webpage. </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm from Bonners Ferry, Idaho, and I'm a freshman at Montana Tech, where I'm studying business and playing basketball. Growing up in a small town shaped a lot of who I am and taught me to appreciate the simple things; good people, hard work, and being outdoors. I spend most of my free time playing ball, lifting, or getting outside whenever I can. My faith is also a big part of my life, and being a Christian reminds me to stay grounded and keep a positive outlook no matter what's going on. Overall, I'm just focused on getting better every day, on the court and off it.
