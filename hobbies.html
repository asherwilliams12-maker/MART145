        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p><li>Basketball is a sport that I have played my whole life. I started playing when I was about 5 years old. I played on a team in my hometown of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. 
        <p><li> I played all the way through high school and now I play for <a href="https://www.mtech.edu/">Montana Tech</a>. I love the competitiveness of the game and the teamwork that is involved. It is a great way to stay in shape and have fun at the same time.</li></p>

        <p><li>In high school, I was fortunate enough to break the all-time scoring record for my school. It was a great accomplishment for me and something that I am very proud of.</p>

        <p><li>Playing basketball has taught me a lot about discipline, hard work, and perseverance. I have learned to set goals for myself and work towards achieving them. It has also helped me to develop strong friendships with my teammates and coaches.</p>
